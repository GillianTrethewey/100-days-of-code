### R1D1 Round 1 Day 1: Tuesday, January 7, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: I've reset my progress on FreeCodeCamp and gone through 65% of the HTML teaching.

**Thoughts** It's good to refresh my knowledge even though I use this every day on my business website.

### R1D2 Round 1 Day 2: Wednesday, January 8, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Up to 68% of HTML on FreeCodeCamp plus revisited the HTML course on Skillcrush. Made notes on Skillcrush HTML Cheatsheet to page four; reinforced Block vs Inline elements, plus HTML5 structural tags and rules.

**Thoughts** Glad to see FCC has updated some of the assistive technologies best practices as well. Making physical notes helps me to have a log to which to refer back.
